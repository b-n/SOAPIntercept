#SOAPIntercept
##Introduction
Heroku nodeJS app which takes a request to /api/&lt;request name here> and saves a file that can be retrieved using /fil/&lt;request name here>. Why? because sometimes it's easier to change an end point than to inspect network logs.

##Build Instructions
Designed to run on Heroku, so a clone, and push should work.

To run locally:
Clone
npm install
foreman start web

Sorted.
